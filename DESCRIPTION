Description: The CO2Mini (model RAD-0301) desktop CO2 monitor from CO2meter.com
    is a low-cost, fairly accurate personal CO2 environment monitor that
    can work standalone (via a USB power brick) or be attacked to a computer
    where it can be both powered and act as a datalogger. Tools are provided
    to retrieve temperature and CO2 readings from such devices.
